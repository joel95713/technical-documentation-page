            Explore the unique traits and strengths of each civilization. From
            the English to the Mongols, each civilization brings distinct
            advantages to the battlefield. Master their abilities and lead your

            In Age of Empires 4, civilizations are more than just cosmetic
            choices. Each civilization has its own set of unique bonuses, units,
            and technologies that reflect the historical strengths of that
            nation. Whether it's the English longbowmen, the Mongol horse
            archers, or the imposing Teutonic Knights, your chosen civilization
            will significantly influence your gameplay strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            To truly master a civilization, it's essential to understand its
            strengths and weaknesses. While some civilizations might excel in
            rapid expansion, others might focus on defensive structures or
            powerful siege weaponry. As you explore and experiment with
            different civilizations, you'll uncover the intricacies of their
            playstyles and develop strategies that suit your preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, the advantage you gain from each civilization goes beyond
            raw power. It's about utilizing their distinct features to adapt to
            various challenges on the battlefield, outsmarting your opponents,
            and leading your nation to dominance in the ever-changing world of
            Age of Empires 4.
